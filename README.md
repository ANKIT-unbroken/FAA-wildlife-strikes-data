# FAA-wildlife-strikes-data (Tableau)
Analysing the datset for Federal Aerial Adminstration (FAA) wildlife strikes on aircrafts  in U.S dataset.
During the past century, wildlife-aircraft strikes have resulted in the loss of hundreds of lives worldwide, as well as billions of dollars in aircraft damage.

1. Aircraft damages & costs in various states in US:


Analyzing interesting values and combination in the data & comparing the aircraft damages & costs in different states across U.S in 15 years.

2: The altitude & impact relationship:

 In this chart dimensions impact to flight & phase of flight was used to compare against measure feet above ground.

 The feet above ground signifies that for most of the aircrafts it is directly correlated with amount of the damage. The amount of damage was substantial at high altitudes.
 
 
 
 
 3.WIldlife encounters at different altitudes:

A Dual Axial approach for generating graph  to compare different species encounters at higher altitudes.


It was found that Gulls are among the birds that caused damage to aircrafts at high altitudes of  where Horned larks caused damage at low altitudes of 10 ft. 
 
 
 
 4. The species that caused the most damage:

A Tree map for determining the amount of damages caused with species.

However, for Geese the number of strikes is low, but, the amount of damage is substantial along with the aircraft being out of service for average is highest - 2160 hours.

  
  * (Reportedly In united states Canada Geese are reported to have higher amount of 
     damage than any other bird species)
 
 
 
 
 
 5. Number of strikes from 2000-2015:


Generating an area plot that shows the number of strikes over the years in different states with California, Texas and Florida have a significant rise in strikes in past few years.

 All of the states have increased number of strikes in last four years with more than 250 strikes in a year.
 
 

6. Top 10 Airports with highest number of strikes

Using a bar chart to show the highest number of strikes were recorded at Dallas International airport followed by Denver International airport

The data includes aircraft type, altitude, time of day and other circumstances. These information could help airports design countermeasures, like firing air cannons to scare birds, sending out chase dogs, filling in nearby ponds to discourage troublesome species, or mowing the grass near airports, more often to discourage creatures that like tall grass, or less often for those that like open habitat.
